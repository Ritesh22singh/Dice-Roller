# Dice-Roller
The Dice Roller project is a fun and interactive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to roll virtual dice with just a click of a button, simulating the experience of rolling physical dice.

Key Features:
Dynamic Dice Rolling: Users can click a button to roll the dice, which generates a random number between 1 and 6, mimicking a real dice roll.
Responsive Design: The interface is styled using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and responsive layout across various devices.
Interactive Animations: JavaScript is used to add rolling animations for a more engaging user experience.
Random Number Generation: JavaScript's Math.random() function ensures the randomness of the dice outcomes, making it feel authentic.
This project showcases my skills in front-end development, combining clean HTML structure, creative CSS styling, and functional JavaScript programming to create an enjoyable and interactive tool. It's perfect for casual games or as a teaching aid for demonstrating basic programming concepts.
